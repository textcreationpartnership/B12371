            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Presuppose (Christian Reader) that thou canst not be ignorant of the great number of learned bookes now extant, touching the Controuersies betweene the Papists and our selues, about the truth of Christian Religion: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I stand in some doubt, that thou wilt reiect this vnlearned Pamphlet of mine, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needelesse, proceeding from so weake an Author.</p>
            <p>But mistake me not, for knowing my selfe not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to write scholer-like, I haue therefore endeuoured to write Christian-like. (Euery Christian is not skilfull in Artes, neyther is euery great scholer a true Christian.) My whole intent in the penning hereof, is no more but to lay open vnto the zealous seduced Papist, that the Church of Rome doth erre; which truth being once made manifest to the aduersary, the maine pillar of popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is thereby vtterly ruinated, and peace among Christians vniuersally to be expected. But vnlesse it be first made manifest vnto him, that the visible Church may erre, sooner may the world be filled with bookes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, then we to agree all in one profession.</p>
            <p>Therefore to the effecting whereof (notwithstanding all former bookes) let euery good Christian Souldier vse his best endeuours, and euery man decently according to his vocation; remembring this by the way, that as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour doth weaken many great ones, so truth is able to strƒìgthen many little ones. And aboue all things, be sure that thou doost endeuour, as well to expresse Christ true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by workes, as to professe him truely by words: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the mortified Papist, notwithstanding his ignorance, may iustly alleage more against thee, then thou art able to alleage against him.</p>
            <p>Therefore, that we may be all true Christians, both in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed and word, let euery one seeke as well to reforme the one as the other, Farewell.</p>

               </gap> he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">Tit. 3</note> against his owne conscience; that is, he sinneth against his own reason and vnderstanding for there is not any Heretike whosoeuer: that goes about to
<pb facs="tcp:177919:3"/> make good by Scripture any heresie whatsoeuer, but he shall thereby be forced to argue vndirectly and absurdly, and against all reason: for it is not possible directly to collect falshood of trueth; for God cannot lye, neither is his word vnperfectly written, being penned by the direction of himselfe, the authour of all perfection. Yea, so perfect and true it is in all respects, that it is damnable to adde or diminish one word to or from it <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

But this beeing <note place="margin">Deu. 4. 12 Gala. 3 22.</note> granted, which cannot well bee denyed, what then may be the cause, that graue men and great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers cannot perceiue their owne absurdities, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining of errors by holy Scripture? Verely, it may well be thought, that because worldly wisdome is now so much in request on all sides, therefore hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly wisedome is hardly found out on any side. The naturall man perceiueth not the things of the spirit of God; for they are foolishnesse vnto him, &amp;c. but he that is spirituall, discerneth all things <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To these things I answere; first, it is true, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the same place of <hi>S Peter,</hi> that to some the Scriptures are hard to be vnderstood, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle shewes there, to whom, namely, vnto the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and vnstable; to all obstinate heretikes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they are hard to be vnderstood; but doeth it therfore follow, that to the mƒì of God, they are also hard to be vnderstood? no verely, for <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth
<pb facs="tcp:177919:5"/> approue the contrary, saying, that the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is giuen to that end, that the men of God may be made perfect <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. If it be demaunded, who are the <note place="margin">Rom. 15. &amp; 2. Tim. 3. Rom 8.</note> men of God? It may be truely answered, they only are the men of God, that haue the spirit of Christ; for he that hath not that spirit, is not of Christ at al <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, be he learned or ignorant. And therfore in respect of Conscience, no Christian ought to be barrd fr≈ç the reading of holy Scripture: for by the great goodnesse of almighty God, (who respects neyther the greatnesse nor littlenesse of persons) the least may as soone obtaine the same Spirit of Truth, as the greatest <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It can not then proceede from heauenly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> to barre spirituall men from their due, fearing lest carnall men might take hurt. There are many better wayes to preuent euill, then by omitting to do good; for that is no better then to commit euill. The Deuill did alleadge Scripture against Christ: But Christ did confound the Deuill by Scripture <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as touching the Church, true it is also, that whosoeuer they be that are members of the holy Catholike Church, the Communion of Saints, can not finally erre, for that is the onely Church, against
<pb facs="tcp:177919:5"/> which, hell gates cannot preuayle. (If thou be in the Church, sayth <hi>S. Ambrose</hi>

But to gra≈´t that sole pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge to the Church of Rome, or to any other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church wheresoeuer, were nothing els, but by authority to maintaine error for truth; an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent example whereof we haue seene, by those euils which grew by abusing the authority of the Chaire of Moses, to which now in the new law we will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Chaire of S. Peter to be answerable.</p>
            <p>The Scribes and the Pharises sit in Moses seat (saith Christ) therfore whatsoeuer they bid you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that obserue and do, but after their workes do not; for they say, and do not <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Here, by our Sauiour himselfe we see, that both faithfull, and faithlesse Iewes, were to obey the Church: but how, absolutely in all things? no: for in an other place <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> he commaunds them to beware <note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> of the leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces, meaning thereby, their owne doctrines and traditions, which in truth were nothing els but their owne works: &amp; this doth manifestly proue, that (notwithstanding the chayre of Moses) their Church might erre: yea Christ sayth plainely <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, that they made the word of <note place="margin">Math. 15.</note> God of no effect, by meanes of their owne doctrines and traditions; they stood too much vpon the chaire of Moses and their outward calling, boasting (as the Prophet Ieremy sayth <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>) that the law could not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish <note place="margin">Ierem. 18.</note> from the Priest; and that was the onely cause of their great blindnesse, in not discerning Christ the onely substance of the same Scripture which they
<pb facs="tcp:177919:6"/> themselues taught: and euen so now, after the same maner doth the Church of Rome beguile her selfe. Whatsoeuer she teacheth, it must by her owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be held for truth; for be it error or truth, it is the Church that doth teach it: he is therefore an Heretike that doth gainesay it. But if holy <hi>Paul</hi> had bene of the same mind, touching those that sit in authority in the Church, to what end then did hee giue that good admonition to the Galatians, saying; Though that we (the onely visible Church on earth) or an Angell from heauen, preach vnto you other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then that which we haue preached, let him be accursed <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. Againe, the same Apostle sayth plainly, <note place="margin">Gala. 1. 2. Thess. 2.</note> that Antichrist shall sit in the Temple of God <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>; that is, in the Church of God: and our Sauiour himselfe doth auouch as much, saying, that the abomination of desolation shall sit in the holy place <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. And what <note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> may we gather from thence, but profanations &amp; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies to be expected in the visible Church of God? But what may be the cause that such things should take any place in the Church, vnlesse it be, because that by some Churchmƒì which are in authority, the doctrines and traditions of men are regarded, rather then the truth of holy Scripture?</p>
            <p>Let all be done to the edifying of the Church (saith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> and be not children in vnderstƒÅding <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> But who can be more childish in vnderstanding, then they that preferre the customes of men (good or bad) before the truth of holy Scripture? as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who can more contradict the Apostles doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in the same chapter, thƒì those that teach praier
<pb facs="tcp:177919:6"/> and seruice to be vsed in an vnknowne tongue, which most part of the hearers vnderstand not? teaching also innumerable people to rehearse dayly the Articles of our faith, in a tongue which they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not; from which custome no good at all can proceed: but because it hath bene of a long time a custome in the Church of Rome, therfore as vaine as it is, it will hardly yet be left.</p>
            <p>It is Error therefore, and pernicious to hold, that the visible Church of Rome, (or els where) cannot erre: for by that false opinion, the doctrines of men are held to be of as great force, as the word of God, &amp; many errors to passe as currant, as the truth it selfe.</p>
            <p>But long since, and before that false opinion sprung vp in the Church, the later Councels did sometimes correct &amp; amend the former, as <hi>S. Austine</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. de Baptis. contra Dona. lib. 2. Cap. 3.</note> testifieth <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, yea, the Councels themselues testify as much; for if they be well conferred together, it will manifestly appeare, that in some principall poynts, the one doeth contradict the other: (and heere I meane as well generall Councels as others.) And thereby wee may clearely discerne, that with too great a number, and of too long a continuance, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hath bene held for Trueth, and Trueth for Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: for as concerning our doctrine taught in the Church of great Britayne, albeit that those of your side account it in some poynts not onely to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, but also to be as nouelties neuer heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luthers</hi> time; yet the same doctrine in substƒÅce is wholy agreeable to the doctrine of Christ, taught by himselfe, the Apostles, &amp; the primitiue Church.
<pb facs="tcp:177919:7"/> And this might very easily be proued, if the greater part of Christians in this corrupt age, were not of that euill disposition, as rather still stubburnly to contend one with another, then meekely and mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like Christians in deed to admonish one another, euery one being as desirous of his brothers welfare as of his owne. But condemne vs not rashly: for as you mistake vs in one point, so may you also in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>It is wrongfully giuen out by many of you, that we teach a vayne faith without workes to iustifie. But verily we teach no such thing, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for we hold that no faith can iustify, but that faith onely which worketh by loue <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, and the same faith <note place="margin">Gala. 5. and 6.</note> onely we hold to iustifie without the workes of the law, euen according to <hi>S. Paul,</hi> Rom. 3. and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that sence which the ancient fathers held, in saying, Faith onely iustifieth; they neuer meaning thereby a vaine faith, to wit, faith in word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession onely, but a true faith which worketh by loue: for we may well proue from Scripture, that all those which haue not the same true and liuely faith, do as much erre in faith, as in maners, (though not in doctrine:) for a good Tree cannot bring forth euill fruit, neyther can an euill Tree bring foorth good fruit <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A fayned faith and a falsecalled knowledge, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by some to be true faith and true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: but there is but one true faith, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And by this you may well perceiue, that our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine doth neyther deny the doing of good workes, nor the promised reward therof, (for as it is noted before) we acknowledge no other way to heauen, but by faith which worketh by loue:) but indeed to exclude all boasting in man, (because he cannot do any good of himselfe) we attribute all prayse and glory to God alone, from whom all good proceeds: for what haue we that we haue not receiued?

            <p>But to confirme this argument to be inuincible against all Heretikes, let any Heretike with his heresy be brought to the triall of holy Scripture: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some one place thereof being brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, may seeme to agree with him, or not to make against him at all, yet diuers places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being conferred together, he shall then be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced eyther to acknowledge his owne error, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to vnderstand more or lesse in Scripture, then the text doth expresse: and for more confirmation thereof, we will touch one poynt more.</p>
            <p>It is written in the 1. to <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. 4. that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giuing heede to spirits of error, and doctrines of deuils, teaching lyes in hypocrisy, &amp;c. forbidding to marry, and commaunding to abstaine from meates lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be eaten, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here from the truth we proue to the Church of Rome, that the Apostle doth prophesie of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they forbid some to marry, &amp;c. But they denie it, saying, that he doth rather prophesie of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:177919:12"/> because they held marriage vncleane, and therefore altogether vnlawfull: but we (say they) contrary to them, doe hold it a holy Sacrament; and therefore the Apostle doth not there speake of vs at all.</p>
            <p>Wee still vrge them with truth, that the Apostle doth there speake as much of them, as of those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heretikes, and rather of them then of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because in hypocrisie they rather forbid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage then the other, seeming to account of it as an holy thing, and yet forbidding it in some persons, as rather in them prophane then holy, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the holy Scripture doth affirme it honourable in all <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>They yet replie against the plaine text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (as we find by their Rhemish notes vpon the same places) that marriage is not lawfull in a Bishop or Priest, and therefore not honorable in all, but in some, to wit, in such as may lawfully marry, and are lawfully married: not in brothers and sisters, (say they) neyther in persons which haue vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary.</p>
            <p>But this answere of theirs is no better then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding speach: for as it is lawfull for brothers and sisters to marry, they not being married one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or contrary to Gods law: so is it also lawfull for a Bishop or Priest to marry, without making any such vndiscreete vowes to the contrary: for to confound this erronious opinion of theirs, wee shew vnto them, where the same Apostle which did prophesie of this deuilish error, doth auouch a
<pb facs="tcp:177919:13"/> Bishop the husband of one wife, to be vnreprouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

But this is plaine absurdity; for it is one thing to be a maried man the husband of one wife, and another thing to be a widdower that hath bene the husband of one wife: and he that takes fr≈ç Scripture the one for the other, doth apparantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himselfe to erre, in mistaking the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Read the 3, 4, &amp; 5. chapters of the 1. to <hi>Timoth.</hi> (and conferre the 2. verse of the 3, with the 9. of the 5.) and note thereby, who S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought meetest for single life; for euery one can not liue single and chaste, although he would <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>„Äà‚òê„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">Math. 19 1.

            <p>This Argument therefore is not lightly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; for by the inuincible force and strength thereof, all Heretiks may be conuerted or confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for albeit faith be aboue reason, yet faith is not against reason. But it cannot stand with reason &amp; a good conscience, that a Christian should beleeue any thing for truth, which the Scripture doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict: and therefore it followes of necessity, that it cannot stand with reason and a good conscience, that a Christian should beleeue any thing for truth, before he knowes certainely, whether the same be
<pb facs="tcp:177919:13"/> agreeable to holy Scripture or no; for there must be no doubt in faith: and faith is by hearing, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the word of God <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But setting the authority of the Church of Rome aside, who can doubt, that the holy Scripture doeth allowe it lawful in a Bishop or Priest to liue in chaste wedlocke?

            <p>It may well be, that he which hath his conscience sEared with an hot Iron, will doubt of these things: but not any other can make any doubt therein; and therefore not any other can doubt that the Church of Rome is not the true Church of Christ, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assuredly the Antichristian Church, in extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her selfe so much aboue God <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, as to make that <note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.</note> vnlawfull by her owne traditions, which he hath made lawfull by his holy word.</p>
            <p>True chastity and true fasting are highly to be commended; but if there were no Scripture to lay open these hypocriticall errors, yet the absurdities therein are sufficient to proue them meere sollies, proceeding onely from earthly wisdome; for as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the vndiscreet vowes of Priests neuer to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, many of them, in so vowing to omit that which is lawfull, haue bene thereby constrayned to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:177919:14"/> that which is vnlawfull: and this is a truth most euident; yet it is vainely giuen foorth by many, that euery man that doth endeuour himselfe to liue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and chaste, may so liue if he will: but that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is contrary to Scripture, as is noted before.</p>
            <p>Indeed God may bestow that gift of continency vpon whom he will: but it is plaine presumption in any man, to vowe to do that thing which lies not in his power to do, and then afterwards to craue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from God, that he may be able to performe it: for if God should refuse to grant the petition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from such a presumptuous person, what then may be expected in him, but vncleannesse? for marry he will not.</p>
            <p>And as touching fasting, in few words, it is also plaine absurdity, (respecting a Christian fast) to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid a small quantity of some kind of meats, and to allowe a large quantity of an other.</p>
            <p>Therefore let euery man beware, that he neglect not the wisdome of the spirit, contained in holy Scripture, to follow the wisdome of the flesh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the doctrines and traditions of men.</p>

                  <p>It is noted by the learned, that although diuers names comprehend this number, yet none in such ample maner, according to holy Scripture, (all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances therein respected) as the Popes of Rome, since the yeere of grace 666.

            <p>And for as much as there is not any other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that can so much preuayle against that great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary, as the same spirit of truth, who then, but a
<pb facs="tcp:177919:15"/> skornefull Heretike or worldling, will reiect that truth (although neuer so simply vttered) which is brought forth against the same aduersary?</p>
            <p>Simplicity cannot lye to deceiue, because she is not able by craft and cunning to colour a lye, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make it seeme better then it is. Therefore whosoeuer doth reiect a simple truth, is most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be deceiued by a sophisticall lye.</p>
            <p>Simplicity and plaine dealing were neuer enemies to truth, but to error; for Hereticks cannot thereby mainetaine their heresies: but by sophistry and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation they endeuour to proue truth to be error, and error to be truth *. <note place="margin">Colo. 2.</note>

            <p>There is an earthly wisdome belonging to the naturall man, and that wisedome is foolishnes to God, and deceiues many.</p>
            <p>But there is a heauenly wisedome belonging to the spiritual man, which is foolishnes to the world, and that can neyther deceiue, not be deceiued: for he that is spiritual, discerneth all things *. Blessed is <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> he then that is a foole to the world, and wise to God.</p>
            <p>To the man of God, truth is as welcome from a Puny, as from a Philosopher: and why? because both in rich and simple attyre, she is <hi>semper eadem,</hi> alwayes the same. Therefore he is as vaine &amp; sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, that doth reiect the simple truth, being spokƒì to no other end, but to the confounding of deuilish errors, as he that doth reiect Art and science, being vsed to the glory of God; for when all is done and sayd, it is truth that must confound the Deuill, and
<pb facs="tcp:177919:16"/> nothing else but onely truth.</p>
            <p>Let no man therefore forbeare to set her foorth, because he finds himselfe to be ignorant in Arts: for it is better that his ignorance therein be layd open to the world, then truth to lye hid wheresoeuer; for being set forth in a knowne Language, and easie to be vnderstood by the most simple, there is not then any iust cause why Christian truth should be reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at any time.

            <p>In the trying of masteries, and in striuing for vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, policy doth direct the weakest to incounter the weakest, and the strongest to encounter the strongest aduersaries; but where the weakest is well able to resist the strongest, who can doubt which fide is to haue the victory?</p>
            <p>Among Protestands, I am not onely in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the weakest, but the weakest of the weakest (as may be well seene by my weake maner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereof:) yet I doe here iustly forbid any Papist whosoeuer, to reply directly against these things which I haue brought against him, and not thereby to commit manifest absurdity And why do I say this, being but a simple lay man vnlearned, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue that truth on my side, which will neuer be ouercome directly?

<pb facs="tcp:177919:16"/> set themselues together against one simple ProtestƒÅt, he hauing Gods truth on his side, they could neuer preuayle against him: for <hi>si Deus pro nobis, quis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra nos?</hi> If God be for vs, who can be against vs <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
